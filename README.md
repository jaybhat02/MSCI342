# GameTime

GameTime is a web application allowing UWaterloo students to coordinate drop-in sports sessions at one of the two UWaterloo athletic facilities with other students. Students can either post new sessions with various details such as sport, location, time, etc., or able to join existing sessions posted by other students. This helps coordinate drop-in sports times at the UWaterloo facility and organize games.
